# 📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable insights and business-ready visualizations. The work includes data exploration and cleaning using Python, querying data using PostgreSQL, building an interactive Power BI dashboard, and presenting insights through a structured report and presentation.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analytics skills used in real-world business scenarios.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant to business analysis.

It includes multiple attributes such as categorical and numerical fields used for trend analysis, performance tracking, and insight generation.

Data quality issues such as missing values and inconsistencies were identified and addressed during preprocessing.
